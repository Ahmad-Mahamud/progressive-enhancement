      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p class="bg">
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
        That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
        They said,
        <q class="quotes n">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
          This is most unfortunate.
        </q>

        The farmer said,

        <q class="quotes f">
          <em class="maybe">Maybe.</em>
        </q>

        The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
        and in the evening everybody came back and said,
        <q class="quotes n">
          Oh, isn’t that lucky.
          What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!
        </q>

        The farmer again said,

        <q class="quotes f">
          <em class="maybe">
            Maybe.
          </em>
        </q>

        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
        riding it,
        he was thrown and broke his leg.
        The neighbors then said,
        <q class="quotes n">
          Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em>,
        </q>


        and the farmer responded,
        <q class="quotes f">
          <em class="maybe">Maybe.</em>
        </q>

        The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript
        people into the army,
        and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
        Again all the neighbors came around and said,
        <q class="quotes n">
          Isn’t that great!
        </q>
        <q class="quotes f">
          Again, he said,
          <em class="maybe ">Maybe.</em>
        </q>


        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
        complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything
        that happens in it is
        <em class="good">good</em>
        or
        <em class="bad">bad</em>

        — because you never know what
        will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
        you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>

    <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective.
      Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas.
      Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
